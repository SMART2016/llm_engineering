## Neural Network Background  
- Traditional models adjust statistical parameters from data.  
- Neural networks mimic brain-like interconnected neurons.  
- Deep learning stacks many layers for richer pattern recognition.

## Key Innovation: Self-Attention  
- Architecture excels at weighted focus over input sequences.  
- Enables larger models trained faster through parallelism.

## Rise of GPT Series  
- GPT-1 (2018) → GPT-2 (2019) → GPT-3 (2020) → ChatGPT (2022) → GPT-4 (2023) → GPT-4.x/5+.  
- Expanded capabilities, chat alignment, multimodal support.

    2023 : GPT-4 / GPT-4o
    2024+ : GPT-5+
```

## Efficiency Breakthrough  
- Transformer is a scalable optimization rather than a philosophical shift.  
- Reduced cost/time to train large models dramatically.

```

## Reception and Backlash  
- Initial awe followed by critiques (e.g., stochastic parrots).  
- Concern: statistical models misinterpreted as truth.

## Emergent Intelligence  
- Large-scale models exhibit intelligence-like behavior.  
- Emergence remains partially unexplained.

## Agentic AI  
- Agents: LLMs orchestrating workflows, potentially self-calling with tools.  
- Autonomy arises from looped decision making.  
```mermaid
